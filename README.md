This is my final project testing if we can predict points scored by shooting percentage using a variety of models. 
I found ensamble to be the best with an R2 of around 0.40.
I Used the main but got confused by pushing to master instead. My models are called called train_modeltype.
Data split into Test, Train, Validate. All screenshots are there.
